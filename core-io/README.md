# Couchbase JVM Core IO

**Please Note:** The core layer is considered volatile, unsupported API if used directly. While it is stable and 
actively maintained, we are not making any guarantees w.r.t stability across releases. Please rely on the higher level 
bindings such as `java-client` if you need a stable API to work against.
